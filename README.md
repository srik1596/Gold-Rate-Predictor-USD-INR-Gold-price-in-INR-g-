# Gold Rate Predictor (INR per gram from USDâ†’INR exchange rate)

A simple machine learning project that predicts the current gold price per gram in Indian Rupees from the USDâ†’INR exchange rate, powered by a trained linear regression model and deployed with a Gradio interface.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Motivation**: Gold rate in India closely tracks USDâ†’INR exchange rates. This tool provides quick gold price estimates (â‚¹/g) based on the latest exchange rate.
- **Features**:
  - Automated data collection via **yfinance**
  - Conducted EDA and handled outliers
  - Trained a **linear regression** model with **hyperparameter tuning**
  - Deployed a **Gradio UI** for real-time interaction
  - Basic **MLOps practices** integrated (artifact management, reproducibility)
